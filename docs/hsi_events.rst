********************************
Health system interaction events
********************************

The *health system interaction* (HSI) events defined in the model are listed here,
for each event a description of the associated treatment is given along with the
facility level the event can occur at and the corresponding *appointment footprint*
(the appointment requirements for the service of this event as a list of appointment
type codes).

A facility level specified as ? indicates the appropriate facility level is determined
dynamically when running the model.

This information can also be downloaded as a :download:`CSV file <hsi_events.csv>`.
