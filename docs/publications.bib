	abstract = {Background
In all health-care systems, decisions need to be made regarding allocation of available resources. Evidence is needed for these decisions, especially in low-income countries. We aimed to estimate how health-care resources provided by the public sector were used in Malawi during 2015–19 and to estimate the effects of strengthening health-care services.
Methods
For this modelling study, we used the Thanzi La Onse model, an individual-based simulation model. The scope of the model was health care provided by the public sector in Malawi during 2015–19. Health-care services were delivered during health-care system interaction (HSI) events, which we characterised as occurring at a particular facility level and requiring a particular number of appointments. We developed mechanistic models for the causes of death and disability that were estimated to account for approximately 81\% of deaths and approximately 72\% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in Malawi during 2015–19, according to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates; we computed DALYs incurred in the population as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. The disease models could interact with one another and with the underlying properties of each person. Each person in the Thanzi La Onse model had specific properties (eg, sex, district of residence, wealth percentile, smoking status, and BMI, among others), for which we measured distribution and evolution over time using demographic and health survey data. We also estimated the effect of different types of health-care system improvement.
Findings
We estimated that the public-sector health-care system in Malawi averted 41·2 million DALYs (95\% UI 38·6–43·8) during 2015–19, approximately half of the 84·3 million DALYs (81·5–86·9) that the population would otherwise have incurred. DALYs averted were heavily skewed to children aged 0–4 years due to services averting DALYs that would be caused by acute lower respiratory tract infection, HIV or AIDS, malaria, or neonatal disorders. DALYs averted among adults were mostly attributed to HIV or AIDS and tuberculosis. Under a scenario whereby each appointment took the time expected and health-care workers did not work for longer than contracted, the health-care system in Malawi during 2015–19 would have averted only 19·1 million DALYs (95\% UI 17·1–22·4), suggesting that approximately 21·3 million DALYS (20·0–23·6) of total effect were derived through overwork of health-care workers. If people becoming ill immediately accessed care, all referrals were successfully completed, diagnostic accuracy of health-care workers was as good as possible, and consumables (ie, medicines) were always available, 28·2\% (95\% UI 25·7–30·9) more DALYS (ie, 12·2 million DALYs [95\% UI 10·9–13·8]) could be averted.
Interpretation
The health-care system in Malawi provides substantial health gains with scarce resources. Strengthening interventions could potentially increase these gains, so should be a priority for investigation and investment. An individual-based simulation model of health-care service delivery is valuable for health-care system planning and strengthening.

	abstract = {Abstract Faith-based organisations constitute the second largest healthcare providers in Sub-Saharan Africa but their religious values might be in conflict with providing some sexual and reproductive health services. We undertake regression analysis on data detailing client-provider interactions from a facility census in Malawi and examine whether religious ownership of facilities is associated with the degree of adherence to family planning guidelines. We find that faith-based organisations offer fewer services related to the investigation and prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the promotion of condom use. The estimates are robust to several sensitivity checks on the impact of client selection. Given the prevalence of faith-based facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa, our results suggest that populations across the region may be at risk from inadequate sexual and reproductive healthcare provision which could exacerbate the incidence of STIs, such as HIV/AIDS, and unplanned pregnancies. Highlights Investigates whether faith-based facilities provide fewer sexual health services. Uses data on client-provider interactions from a facility-level census from Malawi. Faith-based providers are less likely to investigate STIs and promote condoms. Results are robust to matching and are not driven by client selection.},

	abstract = {Background: Acute Lower Respiratory Infections (ALRI) are the leading cause of post-neonatal death in children under-5 globally. The impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of routine pulse oximetry and oxygen on ALRI outcomes at scale remain unquantified. Methods: We evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of scaling up pulse oximetry and oxygen on childhood ALRI outcomes in Malawi using a new and detailed individual-based model, together with a comprehensive costing assessment for 2024 that includes both capital and operational expenditures. We model 15 scenarios ranging from no pulse oximetry or oxygen (null scenario) to high coverage (90\% pulse oximetry usage, and 80\% oxygen availability) across the health system. Cost-effectiveness results are presented in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental net health benefit (INHB) using Malawi-specific cost-effectiveness threshold of \$80 per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted. Findings: The cost-effective strategy is the full scale-up of both pulse oximetry and oxygen to 90\% usage rate and 80\% availability, respectively. This combination results in 71\% of hypoxaemic ALRI cases accessing oxygen, averting 73,100 DALYs in the first year of implementation and 29\% of potential ALRI deaths, at an ICER of \$34 per DALY averted and \$894 per death averted. The INHB is 42,200 net DALYs averted. Interpretation: Pulse oximetry and oxygen are complementary cost-effective interventions in Malawi, where health expenditure is low, and should be scaled-up in parallel. Funding: UKRI, Wellcome Trust, DFID, EU, CHAI, Unitaid.Declaration of Interest: Besides funding from the Wellcome Trust and UK Research and Innovation going towards authors’ institutions, some authors took on private projects, outside the submitted work.

	abstract = {IntroductionHealth seeking behaviour (HSB) refers to actions taken by individuals who are ill in order to find appropriate remedy. Most studies on HSB have only examined one symptom or covered only a specific geographical location within a country. In this study, we used a representative sample of adults to explore the factors associated with HSB in response to 30 symptoms reported by adult Malawians in 2016.MethodsWe used the 2016 Malawi Integrated Household Survey dataset. We fitted a multilevel logistic regression model of likelihood of ‘seeking care at a health facility’ using a forward step-wise selection method, with age, sex and reported symptoms entered as a priori variables. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and their associated 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). We set the level of statistical significance at P \&lt; 0.05.Results Of 6909 adults included in the survey, 1907 (29\%) reported symptoms during the 2 weeks preceding the survey. Of these, 937 (57\%) sought care at a health facility. Adults in urban areas were more likely to seek health care at a health facility than those in rural areas (AOR = 1.65, 95\% CI: 1.19–2.30, P = 0.003). Females had a higher likelihood of seeking care from health facilities than males (AOR = 1.26, 95\% CI: 1.03–1.59, P = 0.029). Being of higher wealth status was associated with a higher likelihood of seeking care from a health facility (AOR = 1.58, 95\% CI: 1.16–2.16, P = 0.004). Having fever and eye problems were associated with higher likelihood of seeking care at a health facility, while having headache, stomach ache and respiratory tract infections were associated with lower likelihood of seeking care at a health facility.ConclusionThis study has shown that there is a need to understand and address individual, socioeconomic and geographical barriers to health seeking to increase access and appropriate use of health care and fast-track progress towards Universal Health Coverage among the adult population.},

	abstract = {Introduction In 2016, the WHO published recommendations increasing the number of recommended antenatal care (ANC) visits per pregnancy from four to eight. Prior to the implementation of this policy, coverage of four ANC visits has been suboptimal in many low-income settings. In this study we explore socio-demographic factors associated with early initiation of first ANC contact and attending at least four ANC visits (“ANC4+”) in Malawi using the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) data collected between 2004 and 2016, prior to the implementation of new recommendations. Methods We combined data from the 2004–5, 2010 and 2015–16 MDHS using Stata version 16. Participants included all women surveyed between the ages of 15–49 who had given birth in the five years preceding the survey. We conducted weighted univariate, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis of the effects of each of the predictor variables on the binary endpoint of the woman attending at least four ANC visits and having the first ANC attendance within or before the four months of pregnancy (ANC4+). To determine whether a factor was included in the model, the likelihood ratio test was used with a statistical significance of P{\textless} 0.05 as the threshold. Results We evaluated data collected in surveys in 2004/5, 2010 and 2015/6 from 26386 women who had given birth in the five years before being surveyed. The median gestational age, in months, at the time of presenting for the first ANC visit was 5 (inter quartile range: 4–6). The proportion of women initiating ANC4+ increased from 21.3\% in 2004–5 to 38.8\% in 2015–16. From multivariate analysis, there was increasing trend in ANC4+ from women aged 20–24 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.27, 95\%CI:1.05–1.53, P = 0.01) to women aged 45–49 years (aOR = 1.91, 95\%CI:1.18–3.09, P = 0.008) compared to those aged 15–19 years. Women from richest socio-economic position ((aOR = 1.32, 95\%CI:1.12–1.58, P{\textless}0.001) were more likely to demonstrate ANC4+ than those from low socio-economic position. Additionally, women who had completed secondary (aOR = 1.24, 95\%CI:1.02–1.51, P = 0.03) and tertiary (aOR = 2.64, 95\%CI:1.65–4.22, P{\textless}0.001) education were more likely to report having ANC4+ than those with no formal education. Conversely increasing parity was associated with a reduction in likelihood of ANC4+ with women who had previously delivered 2–3 (aOR = 0.74, 95\%CI:0.63–0.86, P{\textless}0.001), 4–5 (aOR = 0.65, 95\%CI:0.53–0.80, P{\textless}0.001) or greater than 6 (aOR = 0.61, 95\%CI: 0.47–0.79, {\textless}0.001) children being less likely to demonstrate ANC4+. Conclusion The proportion of women reporting ANC4+ and of key ANC interventions in Malawi have increased significantly since 2004. However, we found that most women did not access the recommended number of ANC visits in Malawi, prior to the 2016 WHO policy change which may mean that women are less likely to undertake the 2016 WHO recommendation of 8 contacts per pregnancy. Additionally, our results highlighted significant variation in coverage according to key socio-demographic variables which should be considered when devising national strategies to ensure that all women access the appropriate frequency of ANC visits during their pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Background Mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel is an intervention used in the treatment and prevention of schistosomiasis. In Malawi, MDA happens annually across high-risk districts and covers around 80\% of school aged children and 50\% of adults. The current formulation of praziquantel is not approved for use in the preventive chemotherapy for children under 5 years old, known as pre-school aged children (PSAC). However, a new formulation for PSAC will be available by 2022. A comprehensive analysis of the potential additional benefits of including PSAC in the MDA will be critical to guide policy-makers.
Methods We developed a new individual-based stochastic transmission model of Schistosoma haematobium for the 6 highest prevalence districts of Malawi. The model was used to evaluate the benefits of including PSAC in the MDA campaigns, with respect to the prevalence of high-intensity infections ({\textgreater} 500 eggs per ml of urine) and reaching the elimination target, meaning the prevalence of high-intensity infections under 5\% in all sentinel sites. The impact of different MDA frequencies and coverages is quantified by prevalence of high-intensity infection and number of rounds needed to decrease that prevalence below 1\%.
Results Including PSAC in the MDA campaigns can reduce the time needed to achieve the elimination target for S. haematobium infections in Malawi by one year. The modelling suggests that in the case of a lower threshold of high-intensity infection, currently set by WHO to 500 eggs per ml of urine, including PSAC in the preventive chemotherapy programmes for 5 years can reduce the number of the high-intensity infection case years for pre-school aged children by up to 9.1 years per 100 children.
Conclusions Regularly treating PSAC in the MDA is likely to lead to overall better health of children as well as a decrease in the severe morbidities caused by persistent schistosomiasis infections and bring forward the date of elimination. Moreover, mass administration of praziquantel to PSAC will decrease the prevalence among the SAC, who are at the most risk of infection.},

We use the Malawi-specific, individual-based “all diseases – whole health-system” Thanzi La Onse model to estimate the impact this could have on health system capacities, proxied by the availability of human resources for health, and consequently on population health outcomes. We estimate that the projected changes in DAH could result in a 7-15.8\% increase in disability-adjusted life years compared to a scenario where health spending as a percentage of GDP remains unchanged. This could cause a reversal of gains achieved to date in many areas of health, although progress against HIV/AIDS appears to be less vulnerable. The burden due to non-communicable diseases, on the other hand, is found to increase irrespective of yearly growth in health expenditure, if assuming current reach and scope of interventions. Finally, we find that greater health expenditure will improve population health outcomes, but at a diminishing rate.},

	abstract = {Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and the restriction policies implemented by the Government of Malawi may have disrupted routine health service utilisation. We aimed to find evidence for such disruptions and quantify any changes by service type and level of health care. Methods We extracted nationwide routine health service usage data for 2015–2021 from the electronic health information management systems in Malawi. Two datasets were prepared: unadjusted and adjusted; for the latter, unreported monthly data entries for a facility were filled in through systematic rules based on reported mean values of that facility or facility type and considering both reporting rates and comparability with published data. Using statistical descriptive methods, we first described the patterns of service utilisation in pre-pandemic years (2015–2019). We then tested for evidence of departures from this routine pattern, i.e., service volume delivered being below recent average by more than two standard deviations was viewed as a substantial reduction, and calculated the cumulative net differences of service volume during the pandemic period (2020–2021), in aggregate and within each specific facility. Results Evidence of disruptions were found: from April 2020 to December 2021, services delivered of several types were reduced across primary and secondary levels of care–including inpatient care (-20.03\% less total interactions in that period compared to the recent average), immunisation (-17.61\%), malnutrition treatment (-34.5\%), accidents and emergency services (-16.03\%), HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses) tests (-27.34\%), antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiations for adults (-33.52\%), and ART treatment for paediatrics (-41.32\%). Reductions of service volume were greatest in the first wave of the pandemic during April-August 2020, and whereas some service types rebounded quickly (e.g., outpatient visits from -17.7\% to +3.23\%), many others persisted at lower level through 2021 (e.g., under-five malnutrition treatment from -15.24\% to -42.23\%). The total reduced service volume between April 2020 and December 2021 was 8 066 956 (-10.23\%), equating to 444 units per 1000 persons. Conclusion We have found substantial evidence for reductions in health service delivered in Malawi during the COVID-19 pandemic which may have potential health consequences, the effect of which should inform how decisions are taken in the future to maximise the resilience of healthcare system during similar events.},

	abstract = {Background COVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we predict the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity.
Methods The infection fatality ratios (IFR) were predicted by adjusting reported IFR for China, accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions and increases in health system capacity.
Findings The predicted population-level IFR in Malawi, adjusted for age and comorbidity prevalence, is lower than that estimated for China (0.26\%, 95\% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.12\%–0.69\%, compared with 0.60\%, 95\% CI 0.4\% to 1.3\% in China); however, the health system constraints increase the predicted IFR to 0.83\%, 95\% UI 0.49\%–1.39\%. The interventions implemented in January 2021 could potentially avert 54 400 deaths (95\% UI 26 900–97 300) over the course of the epidemic compared with an unmitigated outbreak. Enhanced shielding of people aged ≥60 years could avert 40 200 further deaths (95\% UI 25 300–69 700) and halve intensive care unit admissions at the peak of the outbreak. A novel therapeutic agent which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases, respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity, could reduce projected mortality to 2.5 deaths per 1000 population (95\% UI 1.9–3.6).
Conclusion We find the interventions currently used in Malawi are unlikely to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission but will have a significant impact on mortality. Increases in health system capacity and the introduction of novel therapeutics are likely to further reduce the projected numbers of deaths.},

	abstract = {Background
Medical consumable stock-outs negatively affect health outcomes not only by impeding or delaying the effective delivery of services but also by discouraging patients from seeking care. Consequently, supply chain strengthening is being adopted as a key component of national health strategies. However, evidence on the factors associated with increased consumable availability is limited.
Methods
In this study, we used the 2018–19 Harmonised Health Facility Assessment data from Malawi to identify the factors associated with the availability of consumables in level 1 facilities, ie, rural hospitals or health centres with a small number of beds and a sparsely equipped operating room for minor procedures. We estimate a multilevel logistic regression model with a binary outcome variable representing consumable availability (of 130 consumables across 940 facilities) and explanatory variables chosen based on current evidence. Further subgroup analyses are carried out to assess the presence of effect modification by level of care, facility ownership, and a categorisation of consumables by public health or disease programme, Malawi's Essential Medicine List classification, whether the consumable is a drug or not, and level of average national availability.
Findings
Our results suggest that the following characteristics had a positive association with consumable availability—level 1b facilities or community hospitals had 64\% (odds ratio [OR] 1·64, 95\% CI 1·37–1·97) higher odds of consumable availability than level 1a facilities or health centres, Christian Health Association of Malawi and private-for-profit ownership had 63\% (1·63, 1·40–1·89) and 49\% (1·49, 1·24–1·80) higher odds respectively than government-owned facilities, the availability of a computer had 46\% (1·46, 1·32–1·62) higher odds than in its absence, pharmacists managing drug orders had 85\% (1·85, 1·40–2·44) higher odds than a drug store clerk, proximity to the corresponding regional administrative office (facilities greater than 75 km away had 21\% lower odds [0·79, 0·63–0·98] than facilities within 10 km of the district health office), and having three drug order fulfilments in the 3 months before the survey had 14\% (1·14, 1·02–1·27) higher odds than one fulfilment in 3 months. Further, consumables categorised as vital in Malawi's Essential Medicine List performed considerably better with 235\% (OR 3·35, 95\% CI 1·60–7·05) higher odds than other essential or non-essential consumables and drugs performed worse with 79\% (0·21, 0·08–0·51) lower odds than other medical consumables in terms of availability across facilities.
Interpretation
Our results provide evidence on the areas of intervention with potential to improve consumable availability. Further exploration of the health and resource consequences of the strategies discussed will be useful in guiding investments into supply chain strengthening.

	abstract = {Objective To characterise health seeking behaviour (HSB) and determine its predictors amongst children in Malawi in 2016. Methods We used the 2016 Malawi Integrated Household Survey data set. The outcome of interest was HSB, defined as seeking care at a health facility amongst people who reported one or more of a list of possible symptoms given on the questionnaire in the past two weeks. We fitted a multivariate logistic regression model of HSB using a forward step-wise selection method, with age, sex and symptoms entered as a priori variables. Results Of 5350 children, 1666 (32\%) had symptoms in the past two weeks. Of the 1666, 1008 (61\%) sought care at health facility. The children aged 5–14 years were less likely to be taken to health facilities for health care than those aged 0–4 years. Having fever vs. not having fever and having a skin problem vs. not having skin problem were associated with increased likelihood of HSB. Having a headache vs. not having a headache was associated with lower likelihood of accessing care at health facilities (AOR = 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.26–0.96, P = 0.04). Children from urban areas were more likely to be taken to health facilities for health care (AOR = 1.81, 95\% CI: 1.17–2.85, P = 0.008), as were children from households with a high wealth status (AOR = 1.86, 95\% CI: 1.25–2.78, P = 0.02). Conclusion There is a need to understand and address individual, socio-economic and geographical barriers to health seeking to increase access and use of health care and fast-track progress towards Universal Health Coverage.},

	abstract = {Background
Malawi is progressing towards UNAIDS and WHO End TB Strategy targets to eliminate HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. We aimed to assess the prospective effect of achieving these goals on the health and health system of the country and the influence of consumable constraints.
Methods
In this modelling study, we used the Thanzi la Onse (Health for All) model, which is an individual-based multi-disease simulation model that simulates HIV and tuberculosis transmission, alongside other diseases (eg, malaria, non-communicable diseases, and maternal diseases), and gates access to essential medicines according to empirical estimates of availability. The model integrates dynamic disease modelling with health system engagement behaviour, health system use, and capabilities (ie, personnel and consumables). We used 2018 data on the availability of HIV and tuberculosis consumables (for testing, treatment, and prevention) across all facility levels of the country to model three scenarios of HIV and tuberculosis programme scale-up from Jan 1, 2023, to Dec 31, 2033: a baseline scenario, when coverage remains static using existing consumable constraints; a constrained scenario, in which prioritised interventions are scaled up with fixed consumable constraints; and an unconstrained scenario, in which prioritised interventions are scaled up with maximum availability of all consumables related to HIV and tuberculosis care.
Findings
With uninterrupted medical supplies, in Malawi, we projected HIV and tuberculosis incidence to decrease to 26 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 19–35) cases and 55 (23–74) cases per 100 000 person-years by 2033 (from 152 [98–195] cases and 123 [99–160] cases per 100 000 person-years in 2023), respectively, with programme scale-up, averting a total of 12·21 million (95\% UI 11·39–14·16) disability-adjusted life-years. However, the effect was compromised by restricted access to key medicines, resulting in approximately 58 700 additional deaths (33 400 [95\% UI 22 000–41 000] due to AIDS and 25 300 [19 300–30 400] due to tuberculosis) compared with the unconstrained scenario. Between 2023 and 2033, eliminating HIV treatment stockouts could avert an estimated 12 100 deaths compared with the baseline scenario, and improved access to tuberculosis prevention medications could prevent 5600 deaths in addition to those achieved through programme scale-up alone. With programme scale-up under the constrained scenario, consumable stockouts are projected to require an estimated 14·3 million extra patient-facing hours between 2023 and 2033, mostly from clinical or nursing staff, compared with the unconstrained scenario. In 2033, with enhanced screening, 188 000 (81\%) of 232 900 individuals projected to present with active tuberculosis could start tuberculosis treatment within 2 weeks of initial presentation if all required consumables were available, but only 8600 (57\%) of 15 100 presenting under the baseline scenario.
Interpretation
Ignoring frailties in the health-care system, in particular the potential non-availability of consumables, in projections of HIV and tuberculosis programme scale-up might risk overestimating potential health impacts and underestimating required health system resources. Simultaneous health system strengthening alongside programme scale-up is crucial, and should yield greater benefits to population health while mitigating the strain on a heavily constrained health-care system.

	abstract = {An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” (HBPs), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis (LCOA) achieved the largest health gain—∼8\% reduction in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5\% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future.},

	abstract = {Objective Huge investments in HIV, TB, and malaria (HTM) control in Malawi have greatly reduced disease burden. However, the joint impact of these services across multiple health domains and the health system resources required to deliver them are not fully understood.
Methods An integrated epidemiological and health system model was used to assess the impact of HTM programmes in Malawi from 2010 to 2019, incorporating interacting disease dynamics, intervention effects, and health system usage. Four scenarios were examined, comparing actual programme delivery with hypothetical scenarios excluding programmes individually and collectively.
Findings From 2010-2019, HTM programmes were estimated to have prevented 1.08 million deaths and 74.89 million DALYs. An additional 15,600 deaths from other causes were also prevented. Life expectancy increased by 13.0 years for males and 16.9 years for females.The HTM programmes accounted for 24.2\% of all health system interactions, including 157.0 million screening/diagnostic tests and 23.2 million treatment appointments. Accounting for the anticipated health deterioration without HTM services, only 41.55 million additional healthcare worker hours were required (17.1\% of total healthcare worker time) to achieve these gains. The HTM programme eliminated the need for 123 million primary care appointments, offset by a net increase in inpatient care demand (9.4 million bed-days) that would have been necessary in its absence.
Conclusions HTM programmes have greatly increased life expectancy, providing direct and spillover effects on health. These investments have alleviated the burden on inpatient and emergency care, which requires more intensive healthcare provider involvement.},

Estimating how such investments might impact future population size in Malawi can help policymakers understand effects and value of policies to increase contraception uptake. We developed a new model of contraception and pregnancy using individual-level data capturing complexities of contraception initiation, switching, discontinuation, and failure by contraception method, accounting for differences by individual characteristics. We modeled contraception scale-up via a population campaign to increase initiation of contraception (Pop) and a postpartum family planning intervention (PPFP). We calibrated the model without new interventions to the UN World Population Prospects 2019 medium variant projection of births for Malawi. Without interventions Malawi's population passes 60 million in 2084; with Pop and PPFP interventions. it peaks below 35 million by 2100. We compare contraception coverage and costs, by method, with and without interventions, from 2023 to 2050. We estimate investments in contraception scale-up correspond to only 0.9 percent of total health expenditure per capita though could result in dramatic reductions of current pressures of very rapid population growth on health services, schools, land, and society, helping Malawi achieve national and global health and development goals.},
