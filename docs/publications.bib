	abstract = {As health system modeling (HSM) advances to include more complete descriptions of the production of healthcare, it is important to establish a robust conceptual characterisation of the production process. For the Thanzi La Onse model in Malawi we have incorporated an approach to production that is based on a form of Leontief technology -- fixed input proportions. At first sight, this form of technology appears restrictive relative to the general conception of a production function employed in economics. In particular, the Leontief technology is associated with constant returns to scale, and level sets that are piecewise linear, both of which are highly restrictive properties. In this article we demonstrate that once incorporated into an all disease, agent-based model these properties are no longer present and the Leontief framework becomes a rich structure for describing healthcare production, and hence for examining the returns to health systems investments.},

	abstract = {Malawi is vulnerable to climate-related shocks, which are projected to worsen. Whilst some dimensions of this vulnerability have been characterised, little is known about healthcare sector resilience. Coupling facility-specific data on antenatal care (ANC) service provision in Malawi with gridded precipitation data, we use regression analyses to characterise the historic relationship between precipitation and healthcare access. We estimate that, between 2012 and 2024, precipitation negatively impacted ANC service utilisation in Malawi, with up to 1 in 20 appointments disrupted annually in some districts. Projecting further to 2060 indicates that, cumulatively, up to 250,000 pregnancies could be affected. Notably, if precipitation patterns from 1941–1953 had persisted into the 21st century, disruptions between 2012 — 2024 would be a hundred times less frequent, highlighting the significant influence of anthropogenic climate change on healthcare access. In a country already facing high maternal and neonatal mortality, such disruptions could further hinder access to care and worsen health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Faith-based organisations constitute the second largest healthcare providers in Sub-Saharan Africa but their religious values might be in conflict with providing some sexual and reproductive health services. We undertake regression analysis on data detailing client-provider interactions from a facility census in Malawi and examine whether religious ownership of facilities is associated with the degree of adherence to family planning guidelines. We find that faith-based organisations offer fewer services related to the investigation and prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the promotion of condom use. The estimates are robust to several sensitivity checks on the impact of client selection. Given the prevalence of faith-based facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa, our results suggest that populations across the region may be at risk from inadequate sexual and reproductive healthcare provision which could exacerbate the incidence of STIs, such as HIV/AIDS, and unplanned pregnancies. Highlights Investigates whether faith-based facilities provide fewer sexual health services. Uses data on client-provider interactions from a facility-level census from Malawi. Faith-based providers are less likely to investigate STIs and promote condoms. Results are robust to matching and are not driven by client selection.},

	abstract = {Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and the restriction policies implemented by the Government of Malawi may have disrupted routine health service utilisation. We aimed to find evidence for such disruptions and quantify any changes by service type and level of health care. Methods We extracted nationwide routine health service usage data for 2015–2021 from the electronic health information management systems in Malawi. Two datasets were prepared: unadjusted and adjusted; for the latter, unreported monthly data entries for a facility were filled in through systematic rules based on reported mean values of that facility or facility type and considering both reporting rates and comparability with published data. Using statistical descriptive methods, we first described the patterns of service utilisation in pre-pandemic years (2015–2019). We then tested for evidence of departures from this routine pattern, i.e., service volume delivered being below recent average by more than two standard deviations was viewed as a substantial reduction, and calculated the cumulative net differences of service volume during the pandemic period (2020–2021), in aggregate and within each specific facility. Results Evidence of disruptions were found: from April 2020 to December 2021, services delivered of several types were reduced across primary and secondary levels of care–including inpatient care (-20.03\% less total interactions in that period compared to the recent average), immunisation (-17.61\%), malnutrition treatment (-34.5\%), accidents and emergency services (-16.03\%), HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses) tests (-27.34\%), antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiations for adults (-33.52\%), and ART treatment for paediatrics (-41.32\%). Reductions of service volume were greatest in the first wave of the pandemic during April-August 2020, and whereas some service types rebounded quickly (e.g., outpatient visits from -17.7\% to +3.23\%), many others persisted at lower level through 2021 (e.g., under-five malnutrition treatment from -15.24\% to -42.23\%). The total reduced service volume between April 2020 and December 2021 was 8 066 956 (-10.23\%), equating to 444 units per 1000 persons. Conclusion We have found substantial evidence for reductions in health service delivered in Malawi during the COVID-19 pandemic which may have potential health consequences, the effect of which should inform how decisions are taken in the future to maximise the resilience of healthcare system during similar events.},

We fitted a multivariate logistic regression model of HSB using a forward step-wise selection method, with age, sex and symptoms entered as a priori variables. Results Of 5350 children, 1666 (32\%) had symptoms in the past two weeks. Of the 1666, 1008 (61\%) sought care at health facility. The children aged 5–14 years were less likely to be taken to health facilities for health care than those aged 0–4 years. Having fever vs. not having fever and having a skin problem vs. not having skin problem were associated with increased likelihood of HSB. Having a headache vs. not having a headache was associated with lower likelihood of accessing care at health facilities (AOR = 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.26–0.96, P = 0.04). Children from urban areas were more likely to be taken to health facilities for health care (AOR = 1.81, 95\% CI: 1.17–2.85, P = 0.008), as were children from households with a high wealth status (AOR = 1.86, 95\% CI: 1.25–2.78, P = 0.02).

	abstract = {Introduction In 2016, the WHO published recommendations increasing the number of recommended antenatal care (ANC) visits per pregnancy from four to eight. Prior to the implementation of this policy, coverage of four ANC visits has been suboptimal in many low-income settings. In this study we explore socio-demographic factors associated with early initiation of first ANC contact and attending at least four ANC visits (“ANC4+”) in Malawi using the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) data collected between 2004 and 2016, prior to the implementation of new recommendations. Methods We combined data from the 2004–5, 2010 and 2015–16 MDHS using Stata version 16. Participants included all women surveyed between the ages of 15–49 who had given birth in the five years preceding the survey. We conducted weighted univariate, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis of the effects of each of the predictor variables on the binary endpoint of the woman attending at least four ANC visits and having the first ANC attendance within or before the four months of pregnancy (ANC4+). To determine whether a factor was included in the model, the likelihood ratio test was used with a statistical significance of P{\textless} 0.05 as the threshold. Results We evaluated data collected in surveys in 2004/5, 2010 and 2015/6 from 26386 women who had given birth in the five years before being surveyed. The median gestational age, in months, at the time of presenting for the first ANC visit was 5 (inter quartile range: 4–6). The proportion of women initiating ANC4+ increased from 21.3\% in 2004–5 to 38.8\% in 2015–16. From multivariate analysis, there was increasing trend in ANC4+ from women aged 20–24 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.27, 95\%CI:1.05–1.53, P = 0.01) to women aged 45–49 years (aOR = 1.91, 95\%CI:1.18–3.09, P = 0.008) compared to those aged 15–19 years. Women from richest socio-economic position ((aOR = 1.32, 95\%CI:1.12–1.58, P{\textless}0.001) were more likely to demonstrate ANC4+ than those from low socio-economic position. Additionally, women who had completed secondary (aOR = 1.24, 95\%CI:1.02–1.51, P = 0.03) and tertiary (aOR = 2.64, 95\%CI:1.65–4.22, P{\textless}0.001) education were more likely to report having ANC4+ than those with no formal education. Conversely increasing parity was associated with a reduction in likelihood of ANC4+ with women who had previously delivered 2–3 (aOR = 0.74, 95\%CI:0.63–0.86, P{\textless}0.001), 4–5 (aOR = 0.65, 95\%CI:0.53–0.80, P{\textless}0.001) or greater than 6 (aOR = 0.61, 95\%CI: 0.47–0.79, {\textless}0.001) children being less likely to demonstrate ANC4+. Conclusion The proportion of women reporting ANC4+ and of key ANC interventions in Malawi have increased significantly since 2004. However, we found that most women did not access the recommended number of ANC visits in Malawi, prior to the 2016 WHO policy change which may mean that women are less likely to undertake the 2016 WHO recommendation of 8 contacts per pregnancy. Additionally, our results highlighted significant variation in coverage according to key socio-demographic variables which should be considered when devising national strategies to ensure that all women access the appropriate frequency of ANC visits during their pregnancy.},

	abstract = {An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” (HBPs), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis (LCOA) achieved the largest health gain—∼8\% reduction in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5\% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future.},

	abstract = {Background COVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we predict the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity.
Methods The infection fatality ratios (IFR) were predicted by adjusting reported IFR for China, accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions and increases in health system capacity.
Findings The predicted population-level IFR in Malawi, adjusted for age and comorbidity prevalence, is lower than that estimated for China (0.26\%, 95\% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.12\%–0.69\%, compared with 0.60\%, 95\% CI 0.4\% to 1.3\% in China); however, the health system constraints increase the predicted IFR to 0.83\%, 95\% UI 0.49\%–1.39\%. The interventions implemented in January 2021 could potentially avert 54 400 deaths (95\% UI 26 900–97 300) over the course of the epidemic compared with an unmitigated outbreak. Enhanced shielding of people aged ≥60 years could avert 40 200 further deaths (95\% UI 25 300–69 700) and halve intensive care unit admissions at the peak of the outbreak. A novel therapeutic agent which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases, respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity, could reduce projected mortality to 2.5 deaths per 1000 population (95\% UI 1.9–3.6).
Conclusion We find the interventions currently used in Malawi are unlikely to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission but will have a significant impact on mortality. Increases in health system capacity and the introduction of novel therapeutics are likely to further reduce the projected numbers of deaths.},

	abstract = {As computational capacity increases, it becomes possible to model health systems in greater detail. Multi-disease health system models (HSMs) represent a new development, building on individual level epidemiological models of multiple diseases and capturing how healthcare delivery systems respond to population health needs. The Thanzi la Onse (TLO) model of Malawi is the first of its kind in these respects. In this article, we discuss how we have been bringing economic concepts into the TLO model, and how we are continuing to develop this line of research. This has involved incorporating more sophisticated approaches to account for the effects of the unavailability of healthcare workers, and we are working towards establishing the role of different forms of ownership of healthcare facilities and different management practices. Not only does this broad approach make the model more flexible as a tool for understanding the impact of resource constraints, it opens up the possibility of analysing considerably richer policy scenarios; for example establishing an estimate of the health gain that could be achieved through expanding the workforce or reducing healthcare worker absence.},

	abstract = {Background Development assistance for health (DAH) to Malawi will likely decrease as a fraction of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the next few decades. Given the country’s significant reliance on DAH for the delivery of its healthcare services, estimating the impact that this could have on health projections for the country is particularly urgent. Methods and findings We use the Malawi-specific, individual-based “all diseases—whole health-system” Thanzi La Onse model to estimate the impact that declining DAH could have on health system capacities, proxied by the availability of human resources for health, and consequently on population health outcomes, in the period 2019–2040. We estimate that the range of DAH forecasts considered could result in a 7.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) [5.3, 8.3]) to 15.8\% (95\% CI [14.5,16.7]) increase in disability-adjusted life years compared to a scenario where health spending as a percentage of GDP remains unchanged. This could cause a reversal of gains achieved to date in many areas of health. The burden due to non-communicable diseases, on the other hand, is found to increase irrespective of yearly growth in health expenditure, assuming current reach, and scope of interventions. Finally, we find that greater health expenditure will improve population health outcomes, but at a diminishing rate. The main limitations of this study include the fact that it only considered gradual changes in health expenditure, and did not account for more severe economic shocks or sharp declines in DAH. It also relied on key assumptions about how other factors affecting health beyond healthcare worker numbers —such as consumable availability, range of services available, treatment innovation, and socio-economic and behavioural factors—might evolve. Conclusions This analysis reveals the potential risk to population health in Malawi should current forecasts of declining health expenditure as a share of GDP materialise, and underscores the need for both domestic and international authorities to act in response to this anticipated trend.},

	abstract = {Objective
To estimate the outcome of programmes on human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis and malaria in Malawi across multiple health domains.

Methods
We used an integrated epidemiological and health system model to estimate the impact of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria programmes in Malawi from 2010 to 2019. We incorporated interacting disease dynamics, intervention effects and health system use in the model. We examined four scenarios, comparing actual programme delivery with hypothetical scenarios excluding the health programmes individually and collectively.

Findings
From 2010 to 2019, an estimated 1.08 million deaths and 74.89 million disability-adjusted life years were prevented by the HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria programmes. An additional 15 600 deaths from other causes were also prevented. Life expectancy increased by 13.0 years for males and 16.9 years for females. The programmes accounted for 18.5\% (95\% uncertainty interval, UI: 18.2 to 18.6) of all health system interactions, including 157.0 million screening and diagnostic tests and 23.2 million treatment appointments. Only 41.5 million additional health worker hours (17.1\%; 95\% UI: 15.9 to 17.4\%) of total health worker time) were needed to achieve these gains. The HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria programmes required an additional 120.7 million outpatient appointments, which were offset by a net decrease in inpatient care (9.4 million bed-days) that would have been necessary in their absence.

Conclusion
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria programmes have greatly increased life expectancy and provided direct and spill-over effects on health in Malawi. These investments reduced the burden on inpatient and emergency care, which requires more intensive health worker involvement.},

	abstract = {Global health initiatives have expanded access to treatment for infectious diseases - especially HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria (HTM) - in low- and middle-income countries. However, these “vertically”-funded programs often operate within fragile health systems, where workforce shortages and supply chain failures constrain their effectiveness and sustainability 1,2. Meanwhile, evaluating the health impact and value-for- money of “horizontal” investments in systems, such as supply chain strengthening or boosting healthcare workforce, and their synergies with vertical programs (through “diagonal” investments combining both) - remains challenging because their benefits are mediated through improvements in many aspects of healthcare delivery and are therefore difficult to measure3.
Using a dynamic microsimulation model of Malawi’s healthcare system, we show that a diagonal investment approach yields a four-fold greater health impact, measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, than the vertical approach. This approach not only improves health outcomes for non-HTM causes of DALYs but also amplifies the effect on DALYs caused by HTM. Additionally, diagonal investments offer greater value for money and a 24.94\% higher return on investment (6.67 [5.81 - 6.85] compared with 5.34 [3.44 - 6.24]), even after accounting for their additional costs. Our findings demonstrate that HSS investments generate synergistic effects, amplifying the benefits of GHIs while also strengthening broader healthcare delivery. These results support a shift toward more integrated global health financing strategies.},

We developed an individual-based model of maternal and perinatal health and healthcare in Malawi, situated in a ‘whole-health system, all-disease’ framework (Thanzi La Onse). We modelled sixteen scenarios estimating the impact of current and improved coverage and quality of antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal services from 2023 to 2030. Whilst current service delivery is inferred to avert morbidity and mortality, the largest reductions in the stillbirth, maternal and neonatal mortality rates were observed when the use and quality of all services was maximised concurrently (a 10\%, 52\% and 57\% reduction respectively). When services were considered in isolation, generally, increased coverage without quality improvement did not impact mortality or DALYs. In only three scenarios was a sufficient reduction in neonatal mortality observed to achieve target 3.2 of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and in no scenarios was a reduction in maternal mortality sufficient to achieve SDG target 3.1 observed, reaffirming that system wide investments are essential to achieve these goals.},

	abstract = {Supply chain strengthening (SCS) is a key component in the overall strategy of countries to move towards universal health coverage. Estimating the health benefit of investments in such health system strengthening (HSS) interventions has been challenging because these benefits are mediated through their impact on the delivery of a wide range of healthcare interventions, creating a problem of attribution. We overcome this challenge by simulating the impact of SCS within the Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model, an individual-based simulation of health care needs and service delivery for Malawi, drawing upon demographic, epidemiological and routine healthcare system data (on facilities, staff and consumables). In this study, we combine the results of a previous inferential analysis on the factors associated with consumable availability at health facilities in Malawi with the TLO model to estimate the potential for health impact of SCS interventions in the country. We do this by first predicting the expected change in consumable availability by making a positive change to these factors using previously fitted multi-level regression models of consumable availability. We then run the TLO model with these improved consumable availability estimates. The difference in the DALYs accrued by the simulated population under the baseline availability of consumables and that under improved consumable availability estimates gives us the potential for health impact of SCS interventions which would influence these factors. Countries regularly need to make decisions on allocating resources across a range of health interventions (including service delivery and HSS). Crucial to guide these decisions is a value-for-money (VfM) assessment comparing these interventions. Our analysis offers the first step in estimating the VfM of a sample of SCS interventions and can guide Malawi in its evaluation of alternative health sector investments.},

To inform the Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model, which is the first comprehensive health system model developed for any country, this study uses a cross-sectional, mixed-methods approach to collect data on healthcare worker productivity, patient experiences, facility resources, and care quality. The TLM dataset includes information from 29 health facilities sampled across Malawi, covering facility audits, patient exit interviews, follow-ups, time and motion studies, and healthcare worker interviews, conducted from January to May 2024.
Through these data collection tools, the TLM study gathers insights into critical areas such as time allocation of health workers, healthcare resource availability, patient satisfaction, and overall service quality. This data is crucial for enhancing the TLO model’s capacity to answer complex policy questions related to health resource allocation in Malawi. The study also offers a structured framework that other countries in East, Central, and Southern Africa can adopt to improve their healthcare systems.
By documenting methods and protocols, this paper provides valuable guidance for researchers and policymakers interested in healthcare system evaluation and improvement. Given the formal adoption of the TLO model in Malawi, the TLM dataset serves as a foundation for ongoing analyses into quality of care, healthcare workforce efficiency, and patient outcomes.

The imperative for efficient health spending becomes evident, necessitating strategic allocation of resources to areas with the greatest impact on mortality and morbidity. Health benefits packages hold promise in supporting efficient resource allocation. However, despite defining these packages over the last two decades, their development and implementation have posed significant challenges for Malawi. In response, the Malawian government, in collaboration with the Thanzi la Onse Programme, has developed a set of tools and frameworks, primarily based on cost-effectiveness analysis, to guide the design of health benefits packages likely to achieve national health objectives. This review provides an overview of these tools and frameworks, accompanied by other related analyses, aiming to better align health financing with health benefits package prioritization. The paper is organized around five key policy questions facing decision-makers: (i) What interventions should the health system deliver? (ii) How should resources be allocated geographically? (iii) How should investments in health system inputs be prioritized? (iv) How should equity considerations be incorporated into resource allocation decisions? and (v) How should evidence generation be prioritized to support resource allocation decisions (guiding research)? The tools and frameworks presented here are intended to be compatible for use in diverse and often complex healthcare systems across Africa, supporting the health resource allocation process as countries pursue Universal Health Coverage.},

	abstract = {Background Mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel is an intervention used in the treatment and prevention of schistosomiasis. In Malawi, MDA happens annually across high-risk districts and covers around 80\% of school aged children and 50\% of adults. The current formulation of praziquantel is not approved for use in the preventive chemotherapy for children under 5 years old, known as pre-school aged children (PSAC). However, a new formulation for PSAC will be available by 2022. A comprehensive analysis of the potential additional benefits of including PSAC in the MDA will be critical to guide policy-makers.
Methods We developed a new individual-based stochastic transmission model of Schistosoma haematobium for the 6 highest prevalence districts of Malawi. The model was used to evaluate the benefits of including PSAC in the MDA campaigns, with respect to the prevalence of high-intensity infections ({\textgreater} 500 eggs per ml of urine) and reaching the elimination target, meaning the prevalence of high-intensity infections under 5\% in all sentinel sites. The impact of different MDA frequencies and coverages is quantified by prevalence of high-intensity infection and number of rounds needed to decrease that prevalence below 1\%.
Results Including PSAC in the MDA campaigns can reduce the time needed to achieve the elimination target for S. haematobium infections in Malawi by one year. The modelling suggests that in the case of a lower threshold of high-intensity infection, currently set by WHO to 500 eggs per ml of urine, including PSAC in the preventive chemotherapy programmes for 5 years can reduce the number of the high-intensity infection case years for pre-school aged children by up to 9.1 years per 100 children.
Conclusions Regularly treating PSAC in the MDA is likely to lead to overall better health of children as well as a decrease in the severe morbidities caused by persistent schistosomiasis infections and bring forward the date of elimination. Moreover, mass administration of praziquantel to PSAC will decrease the prevalence among the SAC, who are at the most risk of infection.},

	abstract = {Background
Medical consumable stock-outs negatively affect health outcomes not only by impeding or delaying the effective delivery of services but also by discouraging patients from seeking care. Consequently, supply chain strengthening is being adopted as a key component of national health strategies. However, evidence on the factors associated with increased consumable availability is limited.
Methods
In this study, we used the 2018–19 Harmonised Health Facility Assessment data from Malawi to identify the factors associated with the availability of consumables in level 1 facilities, ie, rural hospitals or health centres with a small number of beds and a sparsely equipped operating room for minor procedures. We estimate a multilevel logistic regression model with a binary outcome variable representing consumable availability (of 130 consumables across 940 facilities) and explanatory variables chosen based on current evidence. Further subgroup analyses are carried out to assess the presence of effect modification by level of care, facility ownership, and a categorisation of consumables by public health or disease programme, Malawi's Essential Medicine List classification, whether the consumable is a drug or not, and level of average national availability.
Findings
Our results suggest that the following characteristics had a positive association with consumable availability—level 1b facilities or community hospitals had 64\% (odds ratio [OR] 1·64, 95\% CI 1·37–1·97) higher odds of consumable availability than level 1a facilities or health centres, Christian Health Association of Malawi and private-for-profit ownership had 63\% (1·63, 1·40–1·89) and 49\% (1·49, 1·24–1·80) higher odds respectively than government-owned facilities, the availability of a computer had 46\% (1·46, 1·32–1·62) higher odds than in its absence, pharmacists managing drug orders had 85\% (1·85, 1·40–2·44) higher odds than a drug store clerk, proximity to the corresponding regional administrative office (facilities greater than 75 km away had 21\% lower odds [0·79, 0·63–0·98] than facilities within 10 km of the district health office), and having three drug order fulfilments in the 3 months before the survey had 14\% (1·14, 1·02–1·27) higher odds than one fulfilment in 3 months. Further, consumables categorised as vital in Malawi's Essential Medicine List performed considerably better with 235\% (OR 3·35, 95\% CI 1·60–7·05) higher odds than other essential or non-essential consumables and drugs performed worse with 79\% (0·21, 0·08–0·51) lower odds than other medical consumables in terms of availability across facilities.
Interpretation
Our results provide evidence on the areas of intervention with potential to improve consumable availability. Further exploration of the health and resource consequences of the strategies discussed will be useful in guiding investments into supply chain strengthening.

	abstract = {Background
Malawi is progressing towards UNAIDS and WHO End TB Strategy targets to eliminate HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. We aimed to assess the prospective effect of achieving these goals on the health and health system of the country and the influence of consumable constraints.
Methods
In this modelling study, we used the Thanzi la Onse (Health for All) model, which is an individual-based multi-disease simulation model that simulates HIV and tuberculosis transmission, alongside other diseases (eg, malaria, non-communicable diseases, and maternal diseases), and gates access to essential medicines according to empirical estimates of availability. The model integrates dynamic disease modelling with health system engagement behaviour, health system use, and capabilities (ie, personnel and consumables). We used 2018 data on the availability of HIV and tuberculosis consumables (for testing, treatment, and prevention) across all facility levels of the country to model three scenarios of HIV and tuberculosis programme scale-up from Jan 1, 2023, to Dec 31, 2033: a baseline scenario, when coverage remains static using existing consumable constraints; a constrained scenario, in which prioritised interventions are scaled up with fixed consumable constraints; and an unconstrained scenario, in which prioritised interventions are scaled up with maximum availability of all consumables related to HIV and tuberculosis care.
Findings
With uninterrupted medical supplies, in Malawi, we projected HIV and tuberculosis incidence to decrease to 26 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 19–35) cases and 55 (23–74) cases per 100 000 person-years by 2033 (from 152 [98–195] cases and 123 [99–160] cases per 100 000 person-years in 2023), respectively, with programme scale-up, averting a total of 12·21 million (95\% UI 11·39–14·16) disability-adjusted life-years. However, the effect was compromised by restricted access to key medicines, resulting in approximately 58 700 additional deaths (33 400 [95\% UI 22 000–41 000] due to AIDS and 25 300 [19 300–30 400] due to tuberculosis) compared with the unconstrained scenario. Between 2023 and 2033, eliminating HIV treatment stockouts could avert an estimated 12 100 deaths compared with the baseline scenario, and improved access to tuberculosis prevention medications could prevent 5600 deaths in addition to those achieved through programme scale-up alone. With programme scale-up under the constrained scenario, consumable stockouts are projected to require an estimated 14·3 million extra patient-facing hours between 2023 and 2033, mostly from clinical or nursing staff, compared with the unconstrained scenario. In 2033, with enhanced screening, 188 000 (81\%) of 232 900 individuals projected to present with active tuberculosis could start tuberculosis treatment within 2 weeks of initial presentation if all required consumables were available, but only 8600 (57\%) of 15 100 presenting under the baseline scenario.
Interpretation
Ignoring frailties in the health-care system, in particular the potential non-availability of consumables, in projections of HIV and tuberculosis programme scale-up might risk overestimating potential health impacts and underestimating required health system resources. Simultaneous health system strengthening alongside programme scale-up is crucial, and should yield greater benefits to population health while mitigating the strain on a heavily constrained health-care system.

	abstract = {Malawi has high unmet need for contraception with a costed national plan to increase contraception use. Estimating how such investments might impact future population size in Malawi can help policymakers understand effects and value of policies to increase contraception uptake. We developed a new model of contraception and pregnancy using individual-level data capturing complexities of contraception initiation, switching, discontinuation, and failure by contraception method, accounting for differences by individual characteristics. We modeled contraception scale-up via a population campaign to increase initiation of contraception (Pop) and a postpartum family planning intervention (PPFP). We calibrated the model without new interventions to the UN World Population Prospects 2019 medium variant projection of births for Malawi. Without interventions Malawi's population passes 60 million in 2084; with Pop and PPFP interventions. it peaks below 35 million by 2100. We compare contraception coverage and costs, by method, with and without interventions, from 2023 to 2050. We estimate investments in contraception scale-up correspond to only 0.9 percent of total health expenditure per capita though could result in dramatic reductions of current pressures of very rapid population growth on health services, schools, land, and society, helping Malawi achieve national and global health and development goals.},
