Building and Understanding Individual Based Models to Inform Health Policy
===========================================

Welcome to this tutorial to help you self-learn how to build individual-based models to inform health policy.  This is intended to be an accessible introduction which requires no existing knowledge.

What is an Individual-based Model?
====================================

Each time the model program is run it generates values of variables that represent the characteristics of individuals and simulates how these change over time. By building a model that accurately reflects real changes in people over time, we can evaluate the potential effects of a policy of introducing a health intervention.

`Here <https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk/Player/5G0ag7CC>`_ is a video describing individual-based models to inform health care policy:

(You don’t need to have watched this video to get started on the tutorial!)

Get started
====================================
We will use a programming language called Python.  We will use Google Colaboratory (“Colab”) which is a website which makes it easy to get started.

The links to click for all the content are below.

You may want to watch `this very brief video <https://youtu.be/VPl2emXVJ1M>`_ that shows you what to expect when you click on the first link.
