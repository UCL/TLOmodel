The *Health Economics and Policy Unit* (HEPU) is a unit within the Department of Health Systems 
under the School of Global and Public Health at the Kamuzu University of Health Sciences. 
It was established in 2018 with support from the Thanzi La Onse Program with the aim of promoting demand, 
generation and use of health economics evidence in health policy and decision making.

Background: Thanzi La Mawa Project
==================================

A video exploring the Thanzi La Mawa project, led by Prof Tim Hallett at Imperial. 
In response to the need for more evidence to support resource allocation decision making processes in Malawi, 
researchers and modellers have partnered with Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, led by Prof Joseph Mfutso-Bengo, 
to develop a 'whole system and all-disease model' for the Malawi health system. 
Discover how their findings could potentially revolutionize healthcare practices and policies, 
ultimately benefiting millions of Malawians.
