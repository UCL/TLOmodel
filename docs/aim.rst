Aims
====
Our fundamental aim is to develop the use of epidemiological and economic science to effect a step-change in the way that health priorities are addressed through policy interventions in low-income countries.

We are doing this by developing a model that represents the generation of healthcare gains that can be used to examine the effect of resource allocation, management and clinical practice, that can contribute to informing decision-making.


Objective
=========
To accomplish this aim, the model represents each step in the generation of health gains: (i) the means by which resources for health generate capabilities to deliver services; (ii) the need  for healthcare, as it arises from the multiple causes of ill-health that affect each person individually over their life; (iii) decisions that are taken to manage mismatches between demand and supply for healthcare services; (iv) the effectiveness of the care as delivered, accounting for gaps in quality in the healthcare system. These distinct processes must be represented within an internally consistent model framework that mediates dynamic feedback among them.

The overall ‘model’ comprises three main modules: Healthcare Production Module (HCPM) - specifies how underlying resources (supply of health-care workers, consumables and facilities and equipment) combine to generate an effective supply in a manner dependent on  technological, motivational and institutional factors; Decision-Making and Management Module (DCMM) - determines the healthcare actually received by individuals that seeks care, subject to the effective supply of resources, the management of those resources (how patients are prioritized, referred and which staff can perform which services) and policy (which services are provided); Epidemiological Module (EM) - represents needs for healthcare (as they arise from disease incidence and progression) and the effect of healthcare received (as delivered).
