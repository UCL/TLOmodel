Our fundamental aim is to develop the use of epidemiological and economic science to effect a step-change in the way that health priorities are addressed through policy interventions in low-income countries.

We are doing this by developing a model that represents the generation of healthcare gains that can be used to examine the effect of resource allocation, management and clinical practice, that can contribute to informing decision-making.
