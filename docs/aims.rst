Aims
====
Our fundamental aim is to develop the use of epidemiological and economic science to effect a step-change in the way that health priorities are addressed through policy interventions in low-income countries.

We are doing this by developing a model that represents explicitly the generation of health gains in a population, which can be used to examine the effect of resource allocation, management and clinical practice, in order to contribute to informing decision-making.


Objective
=========
To create a data-grounded internally-consistent model representation of each step in the generation of health gains:

* The means by which resources for health generate capabilities to deliver services;

* The need  for healthcare, as it arises from the multiple causes of ill-health that affect each person individually over their life;

* Decisions that are taken to manage mismatches between demand and supply for healthcare services;

* The effectiveness of the care as delivered, accounting for gaps in quality in the healthcare system.

* The effect of healthcare, and other forms of programme, on disease burdens in the future.

These distinct processes must be represented within a framework that mediates dynamic feedback between them.
