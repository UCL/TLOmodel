## Consumable Availability Scenarios

This README describes the different **scenarios** used in consumable availability analysis. Each scenario corresponds to a specific level of availability of consumables across health facilities and months. The data for these scenarios are stored in columns such as `available_prop_scenario1`, `available_prop_scenario2`, etc., in the `ResourceFile_Consumables_availability_small.csv`. This is generated by the the following scripts - 1. `consumable_availability_estimation.py` generates the `available_prop` column representing the proportion of instances that a consumables is likely to be available given the levels of availability observed during 2018, 2. `generate_consumable_availability_scenarios_for_impact_analysis.py` generates additional scenarios of consumable availability ans appends them to the file generated by the first script.  

The scenario names below can be specified as parameters for `cons_availability` under `HealthSystem` when running simulations.

### **Base Scenario**
- `default`
  - **Description:** Actual 2018 availability estimates based on OpenLMIS data.
  - **Purpose:** Serves as the baseline for comparisons.

### **Scenarios 1–5: System-Level Improvements at Level 1a + 1b **
These are based on regression analysis performed in [Mohan et al (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38762283/).

| Scenario | Column Name               | Description |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 1        | `scenario1` | All items perform like *non-drug/diagnostic* consumables. |
| 2        | `scenario2` | Scenario 1 + all items match performance of *vital* medicines. |
| 3        | `scenario3` | Scenario 2 + all facilities match those managed by *pharmacists*. |
| 4        | `scenario4` | Scenario 3 + Level 1a facilities perform like Level 1b. |
| 5        | `scenario5` | Scenario 4 + All facilities perform like *CHAM* facilities. |

### **Scenarios 6–9: Benchmarking Against Best Facilities**
| Scenario | Column Name               | Description |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 6        | `scenario6` | All Level 1a/1b facilities match the *75th percentile* facility for each item. |
| 7        | `scenario7` | Same as above but using the *90th percentile*. |
| 8        | `scenario8` | Same as above but using the *99th percentile*. |
| 9        | `scenario9` | Level 1a, 1b, and 2 facilities match the *99th percentile*. |

### **Scenarios 10–11: Horizontal Supply Chain Alignment**
| Scenario | Column Name               | Description |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 10       | `scenario10` | All programs perform as well as *HIV* programs (only levels 1a and 1b updated). |
| 11       | `scenario11` | All programs perform as well as *EPI* programs (only levels 1a and 1b updated). |

Scenarios 6-8 and 10-11 only include levels 1a and 1b where most of the service is delivered and consumable availability is particularly a challenge to match up with the regression-analysis-based scenarios 1-5

### **Scenarios 12–15: HIV Drug Supply Adjustments**
| Scenario | Column Name               | Description |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 12       | `scenario12` | HIV performs as well (i.e. as badly) as general programs (excluding EPI and Cancer), benchmarked at *Facility_Level*. |
| 13       | `scenario13` | HIV performs as well as other programs, benchmarked at *Facility_ID*. |
| 14       | `scenario14` | Same as Scenario 13, but availability scaled *up* by 25%. |
| 15       | `scenario15` | Same as Scenario 13, but availability scaled *down* by 25%. |

---

### **Upper Bound Scenario**
- **`all`**
  - **Description:** All consumables are always available (i.e., 100% availability).
  - **Purpose:** Represents the theoretical upper bound for health gains due to supply improvements.
