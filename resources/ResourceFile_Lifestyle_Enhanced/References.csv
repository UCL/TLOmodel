,baseline in 2018:
,
,17% urban
,83% rural
,
,"assume this is time fixed and is allocated at birth to new births, with same status as mother"

,
,"Comment: Malawi is urbanising I think, so perhaps increase urban and reduce rural by 1% per year? We could use the 2018 census data – should be available end of this year / early next year to see what it is in 2018 and compare with 2008 census and 2010 and 2015 DHS to see trend i.e. whether 1% increase per year seems about right."
,Response: according to world bank the recent proportion urban is increasing by just 0.25% per year.  I’m happy for us tp include this.  https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS?locations=MW
,
,wealth level
,(since recorded in DHS I suggest we use this instead of socio-economic status)
,
,(wealth level is initially based on wealth quintile from 2015 DHS but distribution will not remain uniform if fertility and death rate differ by wealth level)
, 
,baseline in 2018 (assuming not changed since 2015 DHS):
,
,if urban = 1 then
,75% wealth_level = 1
,16% wealth_level = 2
,5% wealth_level = 3
,2% wealth_level = 4
,2% wealth_level = 5
,
,if urban = 0 then
,11% wealth_level = 1
,21% wealth_level = 2
,23% wealth_level = 3
,23% wealth_level = 4
,23% wealth_level = 5
,
,source: DHS 2015
,
,assume this is time fixed and allocated at birth with same status as mother.
,
,
,tobacco use
,(much tobacco use is not in fact cigarettes)
,
,baseline in 2018:
,
,if age < 20 and male then percent using tobacco = 1% x wealth_level
,(i.e. 5 times higher in lowest level)
,if 20 <= age < 40 and male then percent using tobacco = 4% x wealth_level
,if 40 <= age  and male then percent using tobacco = 6% x wealth_level
,if female then percent using tobacco = 0.2% x wealth_level
,
,source: DHS 2015
,
,assume time varying with value allocted age 18 (1% x wealth level) but rate of initiating smoking for those assigned as non-smokers and rate of stopping for those assigned as tobacco users to initially be set at zero.
,
,
,excess alcohol
,
,baseline in 2018:
,
,if age > 18 and male 15% drink excess_alcohol  
,if age >  18 and female 1% drink excess_alcohol
,
,source: WHO 2014 report http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msb_gsr_2014_2.pdf?ua=1
,
,no impact of urban / rural or wealth level
,(if we can contact authors we may be able to see if wealth level has an independent influence)

,
,"assume time varying with value allocted age 18 (15% for men, 1% for women) but rate of initiating alcohol for those assigned as non-excess-drinkers and rate of stopping for those assigned as excess alcohol drinkers to initially be set at zero."
,
,
,low exercise
,(I suggest we create this variable for people aged 18 and over only)
,
,baseline in 2018:
,
,if urban and male 32% have low exercise
,if urban and female 18% have low exercise
,if rural and male  11% have low exercise
,if rural and female 7% have low exercise
