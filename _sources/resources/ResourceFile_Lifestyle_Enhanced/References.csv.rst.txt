   9                83% rural

  15                Comment: Malawi is urbanising I think, so perhaps increase urban and reduce rural by 1% per year? We could use the 2018 census data – should be available end of this year / early next year to see what it is in 2018 and compare with 2008 census and 2010 and 2015 DHS to see trend i.e. whether 1% increase per year seems about right.
  16                Response: according to world bank the recent proportion urban is increasing by just 0.25% per year.  I’m happy for us tp include this.  https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS?locations=MW

  18                wealth level
  19                (since recorded in DHS I suggest we use this instead of socio-economic status)
  20
  21                (wealth level is initially based on wealth quintile from 2015 DHS but distribution will not remain uniform if fertility and death rate differ by wealth level)
  22
  23                baseline in 2018 (assuming not changed since 2015 DHS):
  24
  25                if urban = 1 then
  26                75% wealth\_level = 1
  27                16% wealth\_level = 2
  28                5% wealth\_level = 3
  29                2% wealth\_level = 4
  30                2% wealth\_level = 5
  31
  32                if urban = 0 then
  33                11% wealth\_level = 1
  34                21% wealth\_level = 2
  35                23% wealth\_level = 3
  36                23% wealth\_level = 4
  37                23% wealth\_level = 5

  42
  43
  44                tobacco use
  45                (much tobacco use is not in fact cigarettes)
  46
  47                baseline in 2018:
  48
  49                if age < 20 and male then percent using tobacco = 1% x wealth\_level
  50                (i.e. 5 times higher in lowest level)
  51                if 20 <= age < 40 and male then percent using tobacco = 4% x wealth\_level
  52                if 40 <= age  and male then percent using tobacco = 6% x wealth\_level
  53                if female then percent using tobacco = 0.2% x wealth\_level

  57                assume time varying with value allocted age 18 (1% x wealth level) but rate of initiating smoking for those assigned as non-smokers and rate of stopping for those assigned as tobacco users to initially be set at zero.

  60                excess alcohol
  61
  62                baseline in 2018:
  63
  64                if age > 18 and male 15% drink excess\_alcohol
  65                if age >  18 and female 1% drink excess\_alcohol

  75

  77                low exercise
  78                (I suggest we create this variable for people aged 18 and over only)
  79
  80                baseline in 2018:
  81
  82                if urban and male 32% have low exercise
  83                if urban and female 18% have low exercise
  84                if rural and male  11% have low exercise
