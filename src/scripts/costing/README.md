# Cost Estimation Utility Functions (`cost_estimation.py`)

## Overview

This script provides utlity functions to estimate the **cost of healthcare delivery**. using simulation outputs from the **Thanzi La Onse (TLO)** model. It supports analysis of cost drivers, scenario comparisons, and ROI estimation.
Full description of the method is available in the preprint - [Method for costing a health system using a Health Systems Model](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.22.25320881)

Cost components include:
- üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Human Resources for Health
- üíä Medical Consumables
- üè• Medical Equipment
- üßæ Facility Operating Costs

It also includes utilities for:
- üí∏ Discounting and summarizing costs
- üìä Generating plots (stacked bars, line charts, treemaps)
- üíπ ROI estimation following the method specified in [Reference Case Guidelines for Benefit-Cost Analysis in Global Health and Development](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4015886)
- üìâ Projecting health spending based on  [Dieleman et al.(2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29678341/)

## Adapting to Other Country Settings

To apply this module in a new country:

1. üîÅ Replace all cost files in `/costing/` with local unit costs and assumptions.
2. üè• Update the Master Facilities List to reflect your country‚Äôs health facility types and levels.
3. üó∫ Update population/district files to match local administrative units.
4. üõ† Modify functions such as `get_staff_count_by_facid_and_officer_type()`, `update_itemuse_for_level1b_using_level2_data()` functions if model assumptions (e.g., facility level) differ.
5. üõ† Fix other hard coded assumptions -
   1. The function `update_itemuse_for_level1b_using_level2_data()` is used to deal with the idiosyncrasy of the current model framework which treats levels 1b and 2 as identical.
   2. The line `available_staff_count_by_level_and_officer_type = available_staff_count_by_level_and_officer_type.drop(available_staff_count_by_level_and_officer_type[available_staff_count_by_level_and_officer_type['Facility_Level'] == '5'].index)` drops headquarters from the calculation of HR costs
   3. For equipment costing, the formulae for estimating `service_fee_annual`, `spare_parts_annual` and `major_corrective_maintenance_cost_annual` are based on Malawi HSSP-III assumptions
