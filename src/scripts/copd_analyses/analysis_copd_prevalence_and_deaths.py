"""Script for plotting basic outputs from the Copd module:
 * 1) Prevalence of each category of lungfunction by age/sex [stacked bar chart by age/sex] at in 2010, 2020, 2030
 * 2) Number of deaths compared to the GBD dataset
"""

# todo @Emmmanuel....
#  First thing will be to run the model with Copd registered for 30 years. Then,
#  for (1) In the test file I've written an example of how to get this out of the log. We want stacked bars (that sum
#   to 1.0), for the people in each of the lugnfunction categories; and one bar for each age/sex group.
#  for (2) This is done easily using the `compare_deaths` utility function and there are lots of examples of simple
#   plots being made using those results.
