""" Compute the 5-YEAR SURVIVAL following treatment

To this by creating a simulation with:
 * a very high prevalence of tis_t1 at initiation
 * no one on treatment or diagnosed
 * and usual survival
 * no births
 * no new incidence
... and then examine time between date of treatment and date of death for those treated and those not treated.
