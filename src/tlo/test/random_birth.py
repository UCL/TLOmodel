"""
A simple test module for demonstration purposes.

It polls the population each month, randomly making non-pregnant people pregnant with
a fixed probability, set as a module parameter. Nine months after becoming pregnant
(assuming the mother does not die) a new person is born.

This is not intended to be realistic - there are no sexes, and newborn infants may
become pregnant!
