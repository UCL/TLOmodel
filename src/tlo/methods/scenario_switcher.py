    """This is the `ImprovedHealthSystemAndCareSeekingScenarioSwitcher` module.
    It provides switches that can be used by the `Scenario` class to control the overall performance of the HealthSystem
    and healthcare seeking, which are mediated by many parameters across many modules, and which are of the types
    `pd.Series` and `pd.DataFrame`, which cannot be changed via the `Scenario` class (see
    https://github.com/UCL/TLOmodel/issues/988).
    It does this by loading a ResourceFile that contains parameter value to be updated,
    and makes these changes at the point `pre_initialise_population`. As this module is declared as an (Optional)
    dependency of the module that would be loaded first in the simulation (i.e. `Demography`), this module is
    registered first and so this module's `pre_initialise_population` method is called before any other. This provides
    a close approximation to what would happen if the parameters were being changed by the `Scenario` class.
