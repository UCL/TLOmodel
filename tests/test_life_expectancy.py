    Test the calculation of the probability of premature death from a simulated cohort.

    This function loads results from a dummy cohort (N = 100, with 37 F and 63 M) simulation where all individuals start

    0.16 and 0.37, respectively. The premature deaths amongst these individuals is then the number that have died
    before the age of 70 (default value).

    data from this simulated run and the function get_probability_of_premature_death.
